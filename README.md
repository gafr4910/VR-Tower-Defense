VR Tower Defense


Welcome to VR Tower Defense V1.0!

VR tower defense is a single player VR game where the goal is to defend your castle from an invading hoard of Zombies. In the current version of our game the player is placed near the end of a long track which the zombies navigate down. You are the last line of defense against these brain suckers. Use your Mace to swing and kill any Zombies that come close to you. If you let too many get by you, you lose.
